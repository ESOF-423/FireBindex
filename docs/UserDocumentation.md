## What is Bindex.tk

Bindex.tk is a web application meant to make the task of managing senior community centers simple. We hope the final product will give your members and staff the ability to keep track of everything your center offers with an easy-to-use and effective toolset:

* Administrator tools

   With Administrator tools, you'll be able to manage members and volunteers and all of their information.
   You'll also be able to use search tools to quickly access this information needed for printing forms, writing reports, and grants.
   In addition, you'll be able to create activities, services and meals that members can sign up for.

* Member tools

   Members will be able to view and edit their own information, sign up for and check into activities/meals.
