# User Testing

## Cam Walkuski

Cam Walkuski is 55 years old and is the Managing Director of Business Operations at a software company but does not have any technical skills. She is familiar with user interfaces and how an interface should be intuitive to an unfamiliar user.

#### Her tasks included:

- Create a new admin account for herself
- Create a new event
- Create a new member
- Add that new member to the new event
- Reset her password
- Create a service

#### What we learned:

When creating an admin account:

- The full name field is confusing. Should it be two fields with first and last name? Or is it a username? Does it even matter?
  
When creating a new member:

- She thought the meals selection was how many meals that member would get. We need to change the 0,1,2 selection to In Center Meals, Meals on Wheels, or None.
- There needs to be a success message when a new member is added.
- After the member is created, should it take you back to the blank form? Or should you see the member that you created somehow?
- She entered the incorrect year for the member's birthday, so she wanted to be able to go back and edit just the birthday.
  
When creating a new event or service:

- The dropdown arrow for the date is pretty small and she didn't notice it at first, I'm not sure if there's an easy way to make it bigger.
- Can there be a similar dropdown for the time selection?
- There should be a success message when a new event or service is created.
  
When checking the member in to the event:

- It wasn't intuitive that there was a different member checkin page. She tried to just view the event she had just created and add a member to it on that page.
- She wants a period at the end of the error message "Member not found in database, please try again"
  
When resetting your password:

- After you enter your email address, there should be a message that says 'check your email for a link to reset your password' or something similar.
- When you reset your password through the email link, you only have to enter the new password once but when you do it through the account page, you enter it twice. Should be the same process in both places.
- When using the email link, after you reset your password, you should be redirected to the sign in page.
  
Other observations:

- The page you are on should be 'active' in the navigation. She was a little confused at times about what page she was on and what page she needed to go to.
- She agreed that the 'Services' wording is a little weird. She suggested 'Classes' or 'Courses' instead.
- Should you be able to sign into services the same way that you sign into events?
- We both wondered if there arenthe same date/time picker drop downs when the site is accessed on an ipad.
- She suggested that we duplicate a lot of the buttons that are on the nav-bar on big buttons or pictures on the home page so they can be accessed from more than one place.

#### What we learned:

- We don't necessarily have to add more features to make the product more useable, just polishing the user stories and making sure things can be found in more than one place and making sure there are success messages where necessary will make a big difference.
